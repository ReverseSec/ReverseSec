        <h3>How I Accidentally Discovered a Critical Vulnerability in Easy Anti-Cheat</h3>
        <p class="timestamp">idkhidden [2024-10-28]</p>
        
        <p class="subheading">Introduction</p>
        <p>
            In this write-up, Iâ€™ll walk you through the steps that led to my discovery of a critical vulnerability in Easy Anti-Cheat.
        </p>
        
        <p class="subheading">Discovery</p>
        <p>
            It all started when I was exploring the EAC launcher to understand its security mechanisms. I wondered how difficult it would be to protect my own application. This curiosity led me to start reversing their launcher. After spending a solid day on this, I concluded that there were no proper certificate checks in place. When I noticed the absence of these certificate checks, I got curious and started to think about what might happen if we removed the certificate from the certificate folder.
        </p>
        
        <p class="subheading">Exploit</p>
        <p>
            First, I removed the original game application and renamed my application to match the game's executable. In this case, since I was exploiting Fortnite, I renamed my application to FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe. Since the EAC launcher module doesn't check the validity of the certificate in the Easy Anti-Cheat folder. Using this knowledge, I completely removed the certificates from the folder. Next, I turned to the settings.json file, where I found the correct settings that not only validated but also bypassed the checks, thus successfully completing the exploit. </p>
           <p> The modified settings.json file looked like this:</p>
        <pre>
        {
            "title"                                          :"Fortnite",
            "executable"                                    : "FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe",
            "productid"                                     : "prod-fn",
            "sandboxid"                                     : "fn",
            "deploymentid"                                  : "62a9473a2dca46b29ccf17577fcf42d7",
            "requested_splash"                              : "EasyAntiCheat/SplashScreen.png",
            "wait_for_game_process_exit"                    : "false",
            "hide_bootstrapper"                             : "false",
            "hide_gui"                                      : "false"
        }
        </pre>
        <p>
            Now, if we launch the Easy Anti-Cheat launcher, our application will function seamlessly under EAC protection.

        </p>

        <p class="subheading">Impact</p>
        <p>
            Bypassing EAC protection enables attackers to run unauthorized applications as if they were legitimate game processes, leading to potential security impacts:
        </p>
        <p>Attackers could access restricted resources within the protected application.</p>
        <p>The vulnerability could be exploited to run malicious software disguised as a game client, risking system compromise.</p>        
        <p class="subheading">Conclusion</p>
        <p>
            After finding the vulnerability, I immediately reported it to Epic Games. Unfortunately, upon submission, I was informed that my report was considered a duplicate of a similar issue raised in 2023, yet it has not been fixed. Anyways Thank you for reading my write-up!
