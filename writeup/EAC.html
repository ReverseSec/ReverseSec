        <h3>Tricking Easy Anti-Cheat into Protecting Any Application</h3>
        <p class="timestamp">idkhidden [2024-10-28]</p>
        
        <p class="subheading">Introduction</p>
        <p>
            In this write-up, I’ll walk you through how I stumbled upon a critical vulnerability in Easy Anti-Cheat that makes it possible for any application to enjoy the cozy warmth of EAC protection—no questions asked. Spoiler alert: it’s ridiculously simple.
        </p>
        
        <p class="subheading">Discovery</p>
        <p>
            Like most stories of unintentional chaos, this started with sheer curiosity. I was exploring the EAC launcher, trying to understand how it ticks. My question was innocent enough: How hard could it be to protect my own app with EAC?
        </p>
        <p>
            I dug into the launcher, reverse-engineering my way through its logic. After a solid day of fiddling, I noticed something strange—or rather, something absent: there were no proper certificate checks in place. This was a bit like walking into a vault and realizing the lock was made of cardboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Naturally, I decided to poke the bear. What would happen if I just… removed the certificate from the EAC certificate folder? Would it throw a tantrum? Would it scream at me? Nope. It didn’t care.
        </p>
        
        <p class="subheading">Exploit</p>
        <p>
            Armed with this newfound lack of security, I decided to go all in. First, I removed the original game executable and replaced it with my own application. Specifically, I was messing with Fortnite at the time, so I renamed my app to <code>FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, here’s the wild part: since the EAC launcher module doesn’t validate certificates, I completely removed the certificates from the folder. But wait, there’s more. I matched the settings.json file with the original configuration for the game.
        </p>
        <p>After matching it to look like this:</p>
        <pre>
{
    "title": "Fortnite",
    "executable": "FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe",
    "productid": "prod-fn",
    "sandboxid": "fn",
    "deploymentid": "62a9473a2dca46b29ccf17577fcf42d7",
    "requested_splash": "EasyAntiCheat/SplashScreen.png",
    "wait_for_game_process_exit": "false",
    "hide_bootstrapper": "false",
    "hide_gui": "false"
}
        </pre>
        <p>
            I launched the EAC launcher. Lo and behold, my application was running under the full protection of Easy Anti-Cheat like it was Fortnite itself. Bravo, me.
        </p>

        <p class="subheading">Proof of Concept (PoC)</p>
        <p>

                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
        </p>

        <p class="subheading">Impact</p>
        <p>
            Now, let’s talk about why this is actually serious and not just some coding shenanigan:
        </p>
     
            <p>Unauthorized Access: Attackers could use this method to make EAC protect unauthorized applications, potentially accessing restricted resources in the process.</p>
            <p>Malware Disguises: This vulnerability could let malicious software masquerade as legitimate game clients, risking system compromise.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Conclusion</p>
        <p>
            After stumbling upon this vulnerability, I did the responsible thing and reported it to Epic Games. Their response? “Duplicate report.” Apparently, someone had raised a similar issue back in 2023. Fun fact: it still hasn’t been fixed.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            So, here we are. A vulnerability that lets you trick EAC into protecting anything with the same effort it takes to rename a file.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks for reading this (hopefully entertaining) write-up! And remember, this is for educational purposes only—don’t go causing chaos.</p>
