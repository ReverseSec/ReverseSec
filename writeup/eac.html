<h1>Tricking Easy Anti-Cheat into Protecting Any Application</h1>
<div class="content">
    <p>This article outlines a critical vulnerability discovered in Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) that allows any application to gain the same level of security as a supported game. The exploit is alarmingly simple and requires minimal effort to execute.</p>

    <h3 id="discovery">Discovery</h3>
    <p>The research began with an attempt to better understand how the EAC launcher functions and how it validates applications for protection. After reviewing the system, I noticed a significant flaw: the EAC launcher does not properly validate certificates.</p>
            
    <h3 id="exploit">Exploit</h3>
    <p>With the absence of certificate validation, I first removed the Certificates from the Easy Anti Cheat folder. Then, I proceeded to replace the original game executable (in this case, Fortnite) with the application.</p>
    
    <p>Once the changes were made, I launched the EAC launcher. The launcher did not reject the application, and my application was now running with full EAC protection.</p>

    </p>
    <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>After finding this vulnerability, I reported it to Epic Games. They responded saying it was a "duplicate report," as the issue had been reported in 2023. The most concerning part is that the vulnerability still hasn't been fixed.</p>
